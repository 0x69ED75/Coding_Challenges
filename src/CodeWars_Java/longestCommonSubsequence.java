Finds the largest common subsequence of two strings.

My method does this by storing all possible subsequences of both strings, and then searching both subsequences to find the biggest common subsequences.

Therefore, this solution has quite bad time complexity, as finding all subsequences of a string becomes increasingly time-consuming as string size increases

    Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7AYbpM5YrE
    Uses the fact we know there will be exactly (2^word.length-1) subsequences of any given string.
    the bit representation on every number 0 to (2^word.length-1) is used
    You can then use the current bits which are set to 1 to work out which character of the string to be included in each subsequence
