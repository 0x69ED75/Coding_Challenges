Given two arrays, A and B, return whether the values in array B is the equivalent of all values in array A squared.
The two arrays are not guaranteed to be in the CodeWars_Java.same order, i.e. index 0 of B is not necessarily the squared equivalent of index 0 of A

Valid:
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]

    This solution works by mapping each value in array b to its CodeWars_Java.square root equivalent, sorting the stream, then converting it back into an array.
    Similarly, array a is converted to its absolute value equivalent, then sorted and converted back into an array.
    Now, both arrays are compared using Arrays.equals.

    The solution has a pretty bad time complexity due to .sort having a time complexity of O(nlog(n)), however, this solution is clear and short.
